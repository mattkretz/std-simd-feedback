# Expected Feedback from `simd` in the Parallelism TS 2

You can use the issue tracker of this repository to submit feedback on the Parallelism TS 2 (Clause 9: "Data-Parallel Types").
Of course you can also write and submit your own paper to the committee.
In any case, the feedback needs to be published, so that the C++ committee can act on it.

Relevant WG21 paper asking for specific feedback: [P1915](https://wg21.link/p1915).
